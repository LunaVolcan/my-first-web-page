/* 
<head> -- the top part of your HTML web page. Contains the <title> element, SEO thing, etc. Things here do not display on the web page.

<h1>-<h6> -- headings! Identifying titles of sections of your web page.

<header> -- things like a logo, a navbar, and other site identify elemnents.

1. Find a Google font that fits you personality and add it to your page.

2. Set up some styling! How do you want each section to look? Try to put your name next to the unordered list.

You can experiment with using Grid to lay out your navbar... but we'll do this in a slightly different way with Flexbox next week.

3. Add some colors and fun!!!!
